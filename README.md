## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Every weekend, the integration fetches data from your connected business services
2. **Trend Analysis**: Our algorithm compares current metrics with historical data
3. **Insight Generation**: Based on the analysis, one high-impact recommendation is generated
4. **Delivery**: Monday morning, a concise report is posted to your configured Telex channel

## üîÑ API Endpoints

- `POST /webhook` - Receives scheduled triggers from Telex
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /test-message` - Test endpoint to generate a sample advisor message

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_data_analysis.py
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- All API keys are stored securely and never logged
- Data is processed locally and not stored permanently
- HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
